[Cohorte Technologies](http://cohorte-technologies.com/) is the main
sponsor and user of iPOPO. It uses iPOPO as the basis of all its core
developments, like the [Cohorte Framework](http://cohorte.github.io/).

[PREDIS](https://g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/fr/plateformes/predis)
is a complex of several platforms dedicated for research and education.
These platforms gather many industrials and academic partners working
around emerging axes of electrical engineering and energy management.
PREDIS platforms are part of the Ense3 school which trains high-level
engineers and doctors able to take up the challenges associated with the
new energy order, with the increasing demand of water, both in quantity
and quality, and with the sustainable development and country planning.

The [PREDIS Smart Building platform](https://g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/fr/plateformes/predis)
is mainly focused on energy management in buildings such as offices. Two
laboratories are developing their research activities in Predis, the
[Grenoble Electrical Engineering lab (G2Elab)](http://www.g2elab.grenoble-inp.fr/) and the
[Design and Production Sciences laboratories (G-Scop)](http://www.g-scop.grenoble-inp.fr/).

The main topics studied in PREDIS SB are:

* Multi-sensor monitoring
* User activities and their energy impact analysis
* Multi-physical modelling, measurement handle and sensitivity analysing
* Optimal control strategies development.

[AIR](http://air.imag.fr/) means Ambient Intelligence Room.

Ambient intelligence (AmI) is now part of the everyday world of users.
It is found in all areas of activity: intelligent building with energy
control and maintenance, intelligent electrical grid (*smart grid*),
health care with home care, transportation and supply chain, public and
private security, culture and entertainment (*infotainment*) with
serious games, ...

The AmI applications development relies primarily pooling of expertise
in many areas of computer science and electronics which are generally
purchased separately in university curricula and engineering schools.
AmI education focuses on developing applications for a wide range of
smart objects (the IT server 3G user terminal and the on-board sensor
Zigbee/6LoWPAN instrumenting the physical environment). This teaching
can be done properly only in the context of experimental practice
through group projects and student assignments for various application
areas. The experiments can achieve scaled in specialized rooms.

The AIR platform is a *fablab* ([Fabrication Laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab)) for engineering
students and Grenoble students to invent, create and implement projects
and application objects ambient intelligence through their training. The
platform of the [Grenoble Alps University](http://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) is housed in the
[Polytech Grenoble](http://www.polytech-grenoble.fr/) building. AIR is
an educational platform of the [labex Persyval](http://www.persyval-lab.org/).
