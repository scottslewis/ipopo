# Installation

iPOPO strongly depends on only one external library,
[jsonrpclib-pelix](https://github.com/tcalmant/jsonrpclib), which provides some
utility methods and is required to enable remote services based on JSON-RPC.
It relies on other libraries for extended features, which are listed in the
[requirements](https://github.com/tcalmant/ipopo/blob/v3/requirements.txt) file.

To install iPOPO, you will need Python 3.10 or newer.

Support for Python 2.7 and below 3.10 has been dropped with iPOPO 3.0.

There are many ways to install iPOPO, so let's have a look to some of them.

## System-Wide Installation

This is the easiest way to install iPOPO, even though using virtual
environments is recommended to develop your applications.

For a system-wide installation, just run `pip` with root privileges:

```bash
sudo pip install iPOPO
```

If you don't have root privileges and you can't or don't want to use
virtual environments, you can install iPOPO for your user only:

```bash
pip install --user iPOPO
```

## Virtual Environment

Using virtual environments is the recommended way to install libraries
in Python. It allows to try and develop with specific versions of
libraries, to test some packages, etc. without messing with your Python
installation, nor your main development environment.

It is also useful in production, as virtual environment allows to
isolate libraries, avoiding incompatibilities.

Python 3.3 introduced the `venv` module, introducing a standard way to
handle virtual environments. As this module is included in the Python
standard library, you shouldn't have to install it manually.

Now you can create a new virtual environment, here called *ipopo-venv*:

```bash
python3 -m venv ipopo-venv
```

Now, whenever you want to work on this project, you will have to
activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source ipopo-venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows user, the following command is for you:

```powershell
ipopo-venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Either way, the `python` and `pip` commands you type in the shell should
be those of your virtual environment. The shell prompt indicates the
name of the virtual environment currently in use.

Now you can install iPOPO using `pip`. As you are in a virtual
environment, you don't need administration rights:

```bash
pip install iPOPO
```

iPOPO is now installed and can be used in this environment. You can now
try it and develop your components.

Once you are done, you can get out of the virtual environment using the
following command (both on Linux and Windows):

```bash
deactivate
```

## Development version

If you want to work with the latest version of iPOPO, there are two
ways: you can either let `pip` pull in the development version, or you
can tell it to operate on a git checkout. Either way, a virtual
environment is recommended.

Get the git checkout in a new virtual environment and run in development
mode:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/tcalmant/ipopo.git
# Cloning into 'ipopo'...
$ cd ipopo
$ python3 -m venv ipopo-venv
New python executable in ipopo-venv/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip............done.
$ . ipopo-venv/bin/activate
$ python setup.py develop
# ...
Finished processing dependencies for iPOPO
```

This will pull the dependency (*jsonrpclib-pelix*) and activate the git
head as the current version inside the virtual environment. As the
*develop* installation mode uses symbolic links, you simply have to run
`git pull origin` to update to the latest version of iPOPO in your
virtual environment.

You can now continue to the [quick start](./quickstart.md)
