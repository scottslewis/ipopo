This tutorial presents how to use the iPOPO framework and its associated
service-oriented component model. The concepts of the service-oriented
component model are introduced, followed by a simple example that
demonstrates the features of iPOPO. This framework uses decorators to
describe components.

## Introduction

iPOPO aims to simplify service-oriented programming on OSGi frameworks
in Python language; the name iPOPO is an abbreviation for *injected POPO*,
where *POPO* would stand for Plain Old Python Object.
The name is in fact a simple modification of the
[Apache iPOJO project](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-ipojo.html),
which stands for *injected Plain Old Java Object*

iPOPO provides a new way to develop OSGi/iPOJO-like service components
in Python, simplifying service component implementation by transparently
managing the dynamics of the environment as well as other non-functional
requirements. The iPOPO framework allows developers to more clearly
separate functional code (*i.e.* POPOs) from the non-functional code
(*i.e.* dependency management, service provision, configuration, etc.).
At run time, iPOPO combines the functional and non-functional aspects.
To achieve this, iPOPO provides a simple and extensible service
component model based on POPOs.

## Basic concepts

iPOPO is separated into two parts:

* Pelix, the underlying bundle and service registry
* iPOPO, the service-oriented component framework

It also defines three major concepts:

* A [bundle](../refcards/bundles.rst) is a single Python module, *i.e.*
  a `.py` file, that is loaded using the Pelix API.
* A [service](../refcards/services.rst) is a Python object that is registered
  to the service registry using the Pelix API, associated to a set of
  specifications and to a dictionary of properties.
* A [component](../refcards/ipopo.rst) is an instance of *component factory*,
  *i.e.* a class manipulated by iPOPO decorators.
  Those decorators injects information into the class that are later used by
  iPOPO to manage the components. Components are defined inside bundles.

## Simple example

In this tutorial we will present how to:

* Publish a service
* Require a service
* Use lifecycle callbacks to activate and deactivate components

### Presentation of the Spell application

To illustrate some of iPOPO features, we will implement a very simple
application. Three bundles compose this application:

* A bundle that defines a component implementing a dictionary service
  (an English and a French dictionaries).
* One with a component requiring the dictionary service and providing
  a spell checker service.
* One that defines a component requiring the spell checker and
  providing a user line interface.

![Service hierarchy](/_static/tutorials/spell_checker/spellchecker_arch.svg){.align-center}

The spell dictionary components provide the `spell_dictionary_service`
specification. The spell checker provides a `spell_checker_service`
specification.

### Preparing the tutorial

The example contains several bundles:

* [spell_dictionary_EN.py](../_static/tutorials/spell_checker/spell_dictionary_EN.py)
  defines a component that implements the Dictionary service,
  containing some English words.
* [spell_dictionary_FR.py](../_static/tutorials/spell_checker/spell_dictionary_FR.py)
  defines a component that implements the Dictionary service,
  containing some French words.
* [spell_checker.py](../_static/tutorials/spell_checker/spell_checker.py)
  contains an implementation of a Spell Checker. The spell checker
  requires a dictionary service and checks if an input passage is
    correct, according to the words contained in the wished dictionary.
* [spell_client.py](../_static/tutorials/spell_checker/spell_client.py)
  provides commands for the
  [Pelix shell service](../quickstart.md#play-with-the-shell).
  This component uses a spell checker service. The user can interact
  with the spell checker with this command line interface.

Finally, a
[main_pelix_launcher.py](../_static/tutorials/spell_checker/main_pelix_launcher.py)
script starts the Pelix framework. It is not considered as a bundle as
it is not loaded by the framework, but it can control the latter.

### The English dictionary bundle: Providing a service

The `spell_dictionary_EN` bundle is a simple implementation of the
Dictionary service. It contains few English words.

:::{literalinclude} /_static/tutorials/spell_checker/spell_dictionary_EN.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:::

* The `@Component` decorator is used to declare an iPOPO component. It
  must always be on top of other decorators.
* The `@Provides` decorator indicates that the component provides a service.
* The `@Instantiate` decorator instructs iPOPO to automatically create
  an instance of our component. The relation between components and
  instances is the same than between classes and objects in the
  object-oriented programming.
* The `@Property` decorator indicates the properties associated to
  this component and to its services (*e.g.* French or English language).
* The method decorated with `@Validate` will be called when the
  instance becomes valid.
* The method decorated with `@Invalidate` will be called when the
  instance becomes invalid (*e.g.* when one its dependencies goes
  away) or is stopped.

For more information about decorators, see [](../refcards/ipopo_decorators.rst).

### The French dictionary bundle: Providing a service

The `spell_dictionary_FR` bundle is a similar to the
`spell_dictionary_EN` one. It only differs in the `language` component
property, as it checks some French words declared during component
validation.

:::{literalinclude} /_static/tutorials/spell_checker/spell_dictionary_FR.py
:language: python
:emphasize-lines: 14,18,20,32-41

:::

It is important to note that the iPOPO factory name must be unique in a
framework: only the first one to be registered with a given name will be
taken into account. The name of component instances follows the same
rule.

### The spell checker bundle: Requiring a service

The `spell_checker` bundle aims to provide a spell checker service.
However, to serve this service, this implementation requires a
dictionary service. During this step, we will create an iPOPO component
requiring a Dictionary service and providing the Spell Checker service.

:::{literalinclude} /_static/tutorials/spell_checker/spell_checker.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:::

* The `@Requires` decorator specifies a service dependency. This
  required service is injected in a local variable in this bundle. Its
  `aggregate` attribute tells iPOPO to collect the list of services
  providing the required specification, instead of the first one.
* The `@BindField` decorator indicates that a new required service
  bounded to the platform.
* The `@UnbindField` decorator indicates that one of required service
  has gone away.

### The spell client bundle

The `spell_client` bundle contains a very simple user interface allowing
a user to interact with a spell checker service.

:::{literalinclude} /_static/tutorials/spell_checker/spell_client.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:::

The component defined here implements and provides a shell command
service, which will be consumed by the Pelix Shell Core Service. It
registers a `spell` shell command.

### Main script: Launching the framework

We have all the bundles required to start playing with the application.
To run the example, we have to start Pelix, then all the required
bundles.

:::{literalinclude} /_static/tutorials/spell_checker/main_pelix_launcher.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:::

### Running the application

Launch the `main_pelix_launcher.py` script. When the framework is
running, type in the console: **spell** to enter your language choice
and then your passage.

Here is a sample run, calling `python main_pelix_launcher.py`:

```
INFO:pelix.shell.core:Shell services registered
An English dictionary has been added
** Pelix Shell prompt **
A French dictionary has been added
A dictionary checker has been started
1. Testing Spell Checker: Welcome to our framwork iPOPO
