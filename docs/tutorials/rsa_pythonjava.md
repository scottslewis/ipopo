## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to launch and use the sample application for
[OSGi R7 Remote Services Admin (RSA) between Python and Java](https://wiki.eclipse.org/OSGi_R7_Remote_Services_between_Python_and_Java).
This sample shows how to use the
[iPOPO RSA implementation](../refcards/rsa.rst) to export
and/or import remote services from/to a OSGi/Java process to a Python
iPOPO process.

## Requirements

This sample requires Python 3 and launching the Java sample prior to
proceeding with Starting the Python Sample below.

It is also required to have installed the
[osgiservicebridge](https://pypi.org/project/osgiservicebridge/) package
before continuing.

This [ECF tutorial page](https://wiki.eclipse.org/OSGi_R7_Remote_Services_between_Python_and_Java)
describes how to launch the Java-side sample.
One can [start via Bndtools project template](https://wiki.eclipse.org/OSGi_R7_Remote_Services_between_Python_and_Java#Launching_via_Bndtools_Project_Template),
or [start via Apache Karaf](https://wiki.eclipse.org/OSGi_R7_Remote_Services_between_Python_and_Java#Launching_via_Apache_Karaf).

Once the Java sample has been successfully started, proceed below.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: {note}
You may skip this part if you executed the Java sample following the
instructions above.

It is recommended to read the whole Java part of the tutorial before
continuing. However, for those who just want to see things working, here
are the commands to execute the Java sample:

```bash
# Download Karaf from https://karaf.apache.org/download.html
wget http://archive.apache.org/dist/karaf/4.4.6/apache-karaf-4.4.6.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-karaf-4.4.6.tar.gz
cd apache-karaf-4.4.6.tar.gz
./bin/karaf
```

Once inside karaf, run the following commands:

```
feature:repo-add ecf
feature:install -v ecf-rs-examples-python.java-hello
```

This will add the ECF repository to the Karaf framework, then install
and start all the necessary Java bundles.

Wait for a XML representation of an endpoint (in EDEF format) to be
printed out: the Java side of the tutorial is now ready.

## Starting the Python Sample

In the iPOPO project root directory, start the top-level script for this
sample:

```bash
python samples/run_rsa_py4java.py
```

This should produce output to the console like the following:

```
** Pelix Shell prompt **
Python IHello service consumer received sync response: Java says: Hi PythonSync, nice to see you
done with sayHelloAsync method
done with sayHelloPromise method
async response: JavaAsync says: Hi PythonAsync, nice to see you
promise response: JavaPromise says: Hi PythonPromise, nice to see you
```

This output indicates that

1. The Python process connected to the Java process using the Py4j
   distribution provider
2. RSA discovered and imported the Java-exported `HelloImpl` service
3. RSA created a Python proxy for the `IHello` service instance hosted
   from Java
4. iPOPO injected the `IHello` proxy into the sample consumer by
   setting the `self._helloservice` requirement to the `IHello` proxy
5. iPOPO then called the `_validate` method of the
   `RemoteHelloConsumer` class (in `samples/rsa/helloconsumer.py`)

Here is the source code of the `helloconsumer.py` file, from the
`samples/rsa` folder:

```python
from pelix.ipopo.decorators import (
   ComponentFactory,
   Instantiate,
   Requires,
   Validate,
)


@ComponentFactory("remote-hello-consumer-factory")
# The '(service.imported=*)' filter only allows remote services to be injected
@Requires(
   "_helloservice",
   "org.eclipse.ecf.examples.hello.IHello",
   False,
   False,
   "(service.imported=*)",
   False,
)
@Instantiate("remote-hello-consumer")
class RemoteHelloConsumer:
    def __init__(self):
        self._helloservice = None
      self._name = "Python"
      self._msg = "Hello Java"

    @Validate
    def _validate(self, bundle_context):
        # call it!
      resp = self._helloservice.sayHello(self._name + "Sync", self._msg)
        print(
            self._name, "IHello service consumer received sync response:", resp
      )

        # call sayHelloAsync which returns Future and we add lambda to print
        # the result when done
        self._helloservice.sayHelloAsync(
            self._name + "Async", self._msg
      ).add_done_callback(lambda f: print("async response:", f.result()))
        print("done with sayHelloAsync method")

        # call sayHelloAsync which returns Future and we add lambda to print
        # the result when done
        self._helloservice.sayHelloPromise(
            self._name + "Promise", self._msg
      ).add_done_callback(lambda f: print("promise response:", f.result()))
        print("done with sayHelloPromise method")
```

When the `_validate` method is called by iPOPO, it calls the
`self._helloservice.sayHello` synchronous method and prints out the
result (`resp`) to the console:

```python
@Validate
def _validate(self, bundle_context):
    # call it!
    resp = self._helloservice.sayHello(self._name + "Sync", self._msg)
    print(
        self._name, "IHello service consumer received sync response:", resp
    )
```

The print in the code above is responsible for the console output:

```
Python IHello service consumer received sync response:
Java says: Hi PythonSync, nice to see you
```

Then the `sayHelloAsync` method is called:

```python
self._helloservice.sayHelloAsync(
  self._name + "Async", self._msg
).add_done_callback(lambda f: print("async response:", f.result()))
print("done with sayHelloAsync method")
```

The print is responsible for the console output:

```
done with sayHelloAsync method
```

Then the `sayHelloPromise` method is called:

```python
self._helloservice.sayHelloPromise(
  self._name + "Promise", self._msg
).add_done_callback(lambda f: print("promise response:", f.result()))
print("done with sayHelloPromise method")
```

Resulting in the console output:

```
done with sayHelloPromise method
```

Note that the async response and promise response are received after the
`print('done with sayHelloPromise')` statement. Once the remote (Java)
call is completed, the lambda expression callback is executed via
`Future.add_done_callback`. This results in the output ordering of:

```
Python IHello service consumer received sync response: Java says: Hi PythonSync, nice to see you
done with sayHelloAsync method
done with sayHelloPromise method
async response: JavaAsync says: Hi PythonAsync, nice to see you
promise response: JavaPromise says: Hi PythonPromise, nice to see you
```

The 'done...' prints out prior to the execution of the print in the
lambda expression callback passed to
[Future.add_done_callback](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html).

Note that at the same time as the Python-side console output above, in
the Java console this will appear:

```
Java.sayHello called by PythonSync with message: 'Hello Java'
Java.sayHelloAsync called by PythonAsync with message: 'Hello Java'
Java.sayHelloPromise called by PythonPromise with message: 'Hello Java'
```

This is the output from the Java `HelloImpl` implementation code:

```java
public String sayHello(String from, String message) {
    System.out.println("Java.sayHello called by "+from+" with message: '"+message+"'");
    return "Java says: Hi "+from + ", nice to see you";
}
```

## Exporting a Hello implementation from Python to Java

In the iPOPO console, give the following command to register and export
a `IHello` service instance from Python impl to Java consumer.

```
$ start samples.rsa.helloimpl_py4j
```

This should result in the Python console output

```
$ start samples.rsa.helloimpl_py4j
Bundle ID: 18
Starting bundle 18 (samples.rsa.helloimpl_py4j)...
Python.sayHello called by: Java with message: 'Hello Python'
Python.sayHelloAsync called by: JavaAsync with message: 'Howdy Python'
Python.sayHelloPromise called by: JavaPromise with message: 'Howdy Python'
```

Here is the Python hello implementation from `samples/helloimpl_py4j.py`:

```python
from pelix.ipopo.decorators import Instantiate, ComponentFactory, Provides
from samples.rsa.helloimpl import HelloImpl


@ComponentFactory("helloimpl-py4j-factory")
# Provides IHello interface as specified by Java interface.
@Provides("org.eclipse.ecf.examples.hello.IHello")
# See https://github.com/ECF/Py4j-RemoteServicesProvider/blob/master/examples/org.eclipse.ecf.examples.hello/src/org/eclipse/ecf/examples/hello/IHello.java
@Instantiate(
   "helloimpl-py4j",
   {
      "service.exported.interfaces": "*",  # Required for export
      # Required to use py4j python provider for export
      "service.exported.configs": "ecf.py4j.host.python",
      # Required to use osgi.async intent
      "service.intents": ["osgi.async"],
      "osgi.basic.timeout": 30000,
   },
)  # Timeout associated with remote calls (in ms)
class Py4jHelloImpl(HelloImpl):
   """
   All method implementations handled by HelloImpl super-class.

   See samples.rsa.helloimpl module.
   """
   pass
```

and here is the `HelloImpl` super-class from `samples/helloimpl.py`:

```python
class HelloImpl:
   """
   Implementation of Java org.eclipse.ecf.examples.hello.IHello service
   interface.
   This interface declares on normal/synchronous method ('sayHello') and two
   async methods as defined by the OSGi Remote Services osgi.async intent.

   Note that the service.intents property above includes the 'osgi.async'
   intent. It also declares a property 'osgi.basic.timeout' which will be used
   to assure that the remote methods timeout after the given number of
   milliseconds.

   See the OSGi Remote Services specification at:
   https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.remoteservices.html

   The specification defines the standard properties given above.
