Property containing the Persistent ID of a service, i.e. a string identifier

the framework.
This is used by the Configuration Admin to bind managed services and
configurations.

factories.

"""
Prototype service factory scope: the factory is called each time the caller
gets the service.
This allows all bundles to have multiples objects for the same service.
