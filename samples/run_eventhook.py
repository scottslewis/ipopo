"""
Runs the framework corresponding to the event listener hook provider.

Use the ``gen_event`` shell command to generate a new service event.

Use ``gen_filtered_event`` to generate an event that will be handled
differently by the hook: after the 3rd occurrence of this event, the service
listener will be filtered out of the handlers.
