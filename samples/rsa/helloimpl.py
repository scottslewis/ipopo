    Note that the service.intents property above includes the 'osgi.async'
    intent. It also declares a property 'osgi.basic.timeout' which will be used
    to assure that the remote methods timeout after the given number of
    milliseconds.

    See the OSGi Remote Services specification at:
    https://osgi.org/specification/osgi.cmpn/7.0.0/service.remoteservices.html

    The specification defines the standard properties given above.
